I am currently a graduate student working on scientific computing. I research on finite element analysis and parallel computing at day, and play with multiple open-source software and algorithm problems at night. I find LeetCode very helpful to reviewing algorithms and prepare for interview questions. Unfortunately, I tend to forget the ideas and implementations of the algorithms that I learned very quickly, and unable to discover the similarities and differences among various algorithms, which is the biggest motivation of mine to create this blog. However, I will be very happy if this blog can help other people like me, who are interested in algorithms and want to improve their problem-solving techniques.

## What I will write and what I won't
I have some experience in programming, and am familiar with C++ language. I also assume my readers know the common data structures fairly well. The future posts will be devoted to analyzing LeetCode problems and implement the algorithms to solve them. I will not explain basic data structures and textbook algorithms. Instead, I will try to summarize the knowledge and techniques used to solve the problems.

## Problem coverage
The posts will be organized by the algorithms or core data structures, basically like the LeetCode tags. I may also write articles on some particularly interesting problems. It is not possible to cover all of the LeetCode problems (at the time writing this blog, the number is 726!), but I will use multiple problems as examples in every post.
